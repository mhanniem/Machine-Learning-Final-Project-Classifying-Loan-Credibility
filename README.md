# Machine-Learning-Final-Project-Classifying-Loan-Credibility

#This is a final group project for my machine learning class. My group and I used Python and Weka to clean and run several classifying techniques on a dataset we got off Kaggle. 
#We ran multiple models including logistic regression, clustering, decision tree, and random forest.
#The goal was to classify whether the applicant would qualify for a loan approval.
